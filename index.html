      Curated expeditions shaped by geography, climate,

<!-- ================= WHY SILKIM ================= -->
<section class="why">
  <div class="why-inner reveal">
    <h2>Why Silkim</h2>
    <p>
      We design journeys that respond to place rather than impose upon it.
      Geography, history, and climate are not backdrops —
      they are the framework through which every route is shaped.
    </p>
    <p>
      Travel, for us, is not about speed or coverage.
      It is about alignment — with terrain, seasons,
      and the quiet logic that landscapes demand.
    </p>
  </div>
</section>

<!-- ================= PRINCIPLES ================= -->
<section class="principles">

  <div class="principle reveal">
    <h3>Landscape First</h3>
    <p>
      Routes are determined by terrain, altitude, river systems,
      and weather patterns — not convenience or checklists.
      Every journey begins with the physical reality of the land.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="principle reveal">
    <h3>Slow by Design</h3>
    <p>
      Fewer places, longer stays.
      We believe time is not something to optimise away,
      but an essential ingredient that allows landscapes,
      cultures, and people to reveal themselves.
    </p>
  </div>

  <div class="principle reveal">
    <h3>Seasonal Intelligence</h3>
    <p>
      Every itinerary is tuned to when a region truly opens —
      climatically, ecologically, and culturally.
      We travel with seasons, not against them.
    </p>
  </div>

    Silkim journeys are not designed to be consumed quickly.
